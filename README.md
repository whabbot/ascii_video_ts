# ASCII Video

This web application captures video from the user's webcam and converts it in real-time into ASCII art.
Users can adjust the resolution, toggle greyscale mode, and choose between different rendering methods.

The application demonstrates:

- Real-time video processing using the WebRTC API
- Canvas manipulation for video processing
- Dynamic ASCII art generation
- Performance-optimized rendering techniques

Key features:

- Adjustable resolution for performance vs. detail
- Greyscale mode for better contrast
- Multiple rendering methods (Canvas and Span-based)
- Responsive design that works across devices

## TODO

- Allow setting fps
- WebGL version
- Allow taking picture and saving
- Take audio input and modulate the video (colour? Size of text?)
